# project_486
The purpose of this repository is to keep all of my project files. I've compiled what was useful in the project_clean.ipynb. 

The iteration and feedback process followed something similar to many projects. I began by looking at the data briefly, scaling it, threw some initial models at it, etc. Then I began to go down a path inspired by a project in STAT 666, where we were using cluster analysis in classification. I got feedback and assistance from friends in the MS program. I don't think this needs to be its own file, so I'm keeping it in the README.md.
